    <center><p>The snow leopard, also known as the ounce, 
        is a felid in the genus Panthera native to the mountain ranges of Central and South Asia. 
        It is listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List because the global population is estimated to number fewer than 10,000 
        mature individuals and is expected to decline about 10% by 2040.. It is threatened by poaching and habitat destruction following infrastructural developments. 
        It inhabits alpine and subalpine zones at elevations of 3,000–4,500 m (9,800–14,800 ft), ranging from eastern Afghanistan, the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau to southern Siberia, 
        Mongolia and western China. In the northern part of its range, it also lives at lower elevations.</p>

            Lion-tailed macaques are covered in black fur, and have a striking gray or silver 
            mane that surrounds their face which can be found in both sexes. The face itself is hairless and black, 
            being pinkish in infants less than a year old. They are named not for their mane, but for their tail, 
            which is long, thin, and naked, with a lion-like, black tail tuft at the tip.
            The size of their tail is about 25 cm (9.8 in) in length. Their eyes are a shade of hazelnut with highlighting black eyelids. 
            Lion-tailed macaques, like other macaques, have deep cheek pouches useful for storing food, 
            and are quadrupedal with opposable digits.

            The Asian elephant (Elephas maximus), also known as the Asiatic elephant, is the only living species of the genus Elephas 
            and is distributed throughout the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia, from India in the west, 
            Nepal in the north, Sumatra in the south, and to Borneo in the east. Three subspecies are recognised—E. m. 
            maximus from Sri Lanka, E. m. indicus from mainland Asia and E. m. sumatranus from the island of Sumatra.[1] 
            Formerly, there was also the Syrian elephant or Western Asiatic elephant (Elephas maximus asurus) which was the 
            westernmost population of the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus)

            Gee's golden langur (Trachypithecus geei), also known as simply the golden langur, is an Old World monkey found in a small region 
            of Western Assam, India and in the neighboring foothills of the Black Mountains of Bhutan. Long considered sacred by many Himalayan 
            people, the golden langur was first brought to the attention of the Western world by the naturalist Edward Pritchard Gee in the 1950s. 
            Adult males have a cream to golden coat with darker flanks while the females and juveniles are lighter.

            The Central African rock python (Python sebae) is a species of large constrictor snake in the family Pythonidae. 
            The species is native to sub-Saharan Africa. It is one of 11 living species in the genus Python.
            Africa's largest snake and one of the eight largest snake species in the world (along with the green anaconda, reticulated python, 
            Burmese python, Southern African rock python, Indian python, yellow anaconda and Australian scrub python), 
            specimens may approach or exceed 6 m (20 ft).

            The dugong (/ˈd(j)uːɡɒŋ/; Dugong dugon) is a marine mammal. It is one of four living species of the order Sirenia, 
            which also includes three species of manatees. It is the only living representative of the once-diverse family Dugongidae; 
            its closest modern relative, Steller's sea cow (Hydrodamalis gigas), was hunted to extinction in the 18th century.

            The sea otter (Enhydra lutris) is a marine mammal native to the coasts of the northern and eastern North Pacific Ocean. 
            Adult sea otters typically weigh between 14 and 45 kg (30 and 100 lb), making them the heaviest members of the weasel family, 
            but among the smallest marine mammals. Unlike most marine mammals, the sea otter's primary form of insulation is an exceptionally thick coat of fur, 
            the densest in the animal kingdom. Although it can walk on land, the sea otter is capable of living exclusively in the ocean.

            The chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), also known as simply the chimp, is a species of great ape native 
            to the forest and savannah of tropical Africa. It has four confirmed subspecies and a fifth proposed subspecies. 
            When its close relative the bonobo was more commonly known as the pygmy chimpanzee, this species was often called the 
            common chimpanzee or the robust chimpanzee. The chimpanzee and the bonobo are the only species in the genus Pan.
